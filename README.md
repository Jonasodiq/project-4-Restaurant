### Description:

**In summary, this is a complete HTML structure for a restaurant web page that can be supplemented with CSS to give it style and with JavaScript to add functionality. It is a well-structured and organized web page that includes all the necessary information for the restaurant's visitors.**

#### App Description:

**Gameplay:** The game presents word balloons containing random words that float upward on the canvas.

**User Input:** The player can type letters to form words using an input field. The game accepts input only from valid alphabetical characters.

**Word Matching:** When the player types a valid word and presses Enter, the game checks if that word matches any word on a word balloon. If there's a match, the balloon pops, and the player earns points.

**Scoring:** The player's score is displayed on the canvas, and it increases as they successfully match words.

**Game Loop:** The game runs in a loop, continually rendering and updating the position of word balloons.

**Game Over:** The game ends when all the provided words have been matched with balloons, and the final score is displayed.

**Sound Effects:** There's an option for playing a sound effect when a word is successfully matched.

**Responsive:** The game canvas responds to user interactions, making it interactive and engaging.

**In summary, this app provides an entertaining word-based game where the player can test their vocabulary skills by popping word balloons before they reach the top of the screen.**
